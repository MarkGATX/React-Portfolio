Users can create their own accounts and follow other users as well as create Families so they can easily organize users by groups. Each use can create their own wishlist and fill it with items they want. Other users or visitors to the site can contribute to wishes by using a PayPal integration. Softlife was developed to take advantage of the benefits in NextJS 13 and the file-based App router. The database is handled by MongoDB and authentication and image storage is handled with Firebase. The CSS and styling was built from scratch using SCSS. The look and feel of the site went through many iterations and revisions after my initial pitch. We worked together extensively to move the application from an initial pitch of a 'soft-grunge' design into their final decision to lean into a more minimalist site with an almost mid-century modern feel.",

I've learned a lot about the structure of code and making sure unique layouts stay responsive at various screen resolutions and not just screen width. Even though I'm still working on a functional shopping cart, I'm happy with the overall look and feel.

So I wrote a quick proof of concept pilot to introduce the world and characters and shot it over one weekend. I then edited the final footage and applied all the effects, except our limited creature effects that were done by an animation studio in Austin. In the end I love that we were able to accomplish what we did in such a short time. There are still some things that make me cringe that I wish I had time to reshoot, but all things considered I'm very proud of what we did. The network did pass on the full season, so if anyone wants to fund a great series, have I got a deal for you.",

I was able to get the page completed in the one-hour given and decided that I wanted to keep it around to use. So on occassion I will still post some trick or use of CSS to the Snippet page just in case I want an easy resource later.",

This was my first ever writing on this scale as well as my first effort Producing and Directing for film. It was very successful on Koldcast with millions of views and garnered well over 25 award nominations, including Best Drama, Best Writing, and Best Cinematography. I learned a lot on this project and even with its evident flaws 10 years after the fact, I'm still immensely proud of what our team accomplished together.",
